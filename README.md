Overview\
The channel data of over 4 years, comprising of more than 15,000 rows and 15 columns was analyzed in Microsoft Power BI after initial data cleaning in Microsoft Excel.
The analysis demanded categorization of 112k videos uploaded in that channel owing to which I created a supporting table of videos categorized into 13 categories

Insights\
Found that channel performance deteriorated after 2020 owing to decreased video count in the most favourite category of "Tutorial Videos".

Suggestions for growth\
Suggestions include the top categories of videos to be uploaded, best day to upload for maximum views & reach and country to focus which potentially helps the channel to grow by 25%
